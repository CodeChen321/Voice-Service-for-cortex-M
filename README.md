Why We Need This?
    1) Low Power
    Cortex-m7 are adopted instead of Cortex-a53, Cortex-m7 Core frequecy usually 200MHz~800MHz, while Cortex-a53 usually 1.2GHz~1.8GHz.
    SIP or FLASH is used instead of DDR2/DDR3.

    2) Low Cost
    PCB can use 2-layer or 4-layer, while cortex-a53 usually 6-layer. DDR is expensive than Flash of the same size, What's more cortex-m7 chip is also usually chiper than cortex-a53.

    3)fast and simpler than android
    The PCBA is much easier to design and debug. Don't need android engineer, no need to run JAVA virtual machin. All your team need is c and RTOS, may be two or three software engineers is enough
    for your products.

    4)Complete far-field AI speech supported
    Two or four micphones are supported according to our schedual.


    Who are interested in this open source project, we want you if you are familar with MCU or Speech algorithment development. you can contact me through shichaog@126.com. Thanks!
